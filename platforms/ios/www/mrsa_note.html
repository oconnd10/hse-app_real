        MRSA infection should be suspected if:<br><br>
        • The patient has been previously colonised with MRSA<br>
        • The patient has recently been hospitalised<br>
        • The patient has been transferred from another hospital or long term care
        facility<br>
        • The patient is on a ward with a current outbreak of MRSA<br><br>
        For patients with serious/life threatening infection who are at risk from MRSA infection, empiric treatment with a glycopeptide (e.g. vancomycin or teicoplanin) is indicated in addition to the other components of therapy recommended in this guideline.<br><br>
        Please consult Microbiology if further advice required.<br><br>
        <p class="infotexttitle"><b>- Prophylaxis -</b></p><br>
        Patients who require surgery and have a history of MRSA colonization or infection without documented eradication should receive teicoplanin prophylaxis alone or in combination with other antibiotics active against other relevant pathogens.<br><br>
        Teicoplanin should also be considered if there is an appreciable risk that the patients MRSA carriage may have recurred or they come from a facility with a high prevalence of MRSA.
